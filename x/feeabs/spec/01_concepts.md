## Fee Deduct

When making a transaction, users typically need to pay fees in the native token of the blockchain. However, it's important to note that the actual fee amount can vary depending on a number of factors.

Another factor to consider is the type of transaction being made. Some types of transactions may require more resources from the network to process, and thus may carry higher fees.

It's also worth noting that fees can be paid in different tokens on some blockchains, although this is less common.

Overall, it's important to carefully consider transaction fees when making any sort of blockchain-based transaction. By doing so, users can ensure that their transactions are processed quickly and efficiently, without paying more than necessary in fees.
